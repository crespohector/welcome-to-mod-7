# Module 7: Welcome Starter Pack

Welcome to Module 7! This repo is meant to hold convenient links for you to use during your capstone projects, and to give a summarized compilation of project requirements. Note this is a living document, things will be continuously changed and updated as needed but capstone requirements WILL NOT change.

```txt
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins please make sure you are keeping your pre-capstone project your top priority. All of this should be considered secondary until that project is done.
```

## Capstone Project Requirements
Projects must have a minimum of **2 working CRUD features** and **base requirements** *(User Auth)* completed by final grade *(W23 D1)*. Only the live site will be used for grading.

![scorecard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76798385/229187286-ba7411c1-5369-4756-9228-e9d3a8234005.png)

**Ex. Project: Airbnb**
- Users (Auth): Create, Read 
1. Listings: Create, Read, Update, Destroy
2. Bookings: Create, Read, Destroy (Not Editable)
3. Reviews: Create, Read, Update, Destroy
4. Ratings: Create, Read (Not Editable, Destroyed with Reviews)
5. *Bonus* Search: Backend Fetch w/ Params (ideal), Frontend filtering. 
6. *Bonus* Google API: Integration

The first feature has to be **full** CRUD. and the second feature can be **3/4** CRUD or full CRUD. In the example above, the bookings feature has the create, read, and Delete. Ideally, update and delete perform the same action so this feature would be considered 3/4 CRUD.

[Example Scorecard Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1koN-rcsiGkHTLgI1H7SLbGqohdotLh2ed-0ybl60eVk/edit#gid=1184667675)

### Error Validations
A User should **NOT** be allowed to update or submit a form with blank or null input fields that are assumed to be required. All input fields within a form are assumed to be required and tested as such. If certain fields within a form are not required, then all required fields must be marked by a different CSS style or an asterisk (*) next to the label to indicate a required field.

Please refer to the Error Validations Repo for more examples.
[Required Error Messages](https://github.com/whitnessme/capstone-minimum-required-error-messages)

### Prepopulating Data For the Update Form
When a User goes to Edit/Update a resource, the edit form must be prepopulated with the previous data. Using the "placeholder" attribute will **not** be accepted by itself. You must be able to dynamically update the value of the input field. This will create a smoother UX for recruiters to look at.

---

## The Big Picture

The Capstone Project is an assessment to test your programming and software engineering skills. The ideal expectation is to have a completed MVP (minimum viable product) application done by W22D2, then use the remaining time to refactor to include additional features and/or polish the user interface and improve the user experience. The long-term goal is to present our best work to recruiters to demonstrate our technical abilities.

Remember, a minimum viable product (MVP) is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project, this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.

We want to make sure we are completing ONE FEATURE before moving on to the next. This feature-driven approach can be seen as an **agile** workflow, whereas the **waterfall** approach can be seen as completing one phase at a time before moving on to the next phase. Agile is an iterative approach where we deliver goals in small incremental amounts. An example of a waterfall workflow would be working on the entire backend first for all features then working on the frontend. 

[Agile vs Waterfall Link](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/agile-vs-waterfall)

Students should have a clear road map during the planning phase of what should be the MVPs for their capstone project.

> The end goal is to have 4 features working. After graduation, to be greenlit you will need to have at least 3 features and the Greenlit requirements done in the scorecard. You will have additional time to work on your projects during post-graduation however, it is ideal to shoot for completing the Greenlit requirements early on.

### A Quick Overview of Project Development Expectations

Based on the pie chart below is a rough estimation of what a typical day for a software developer can look like. This can vary based on the company and the role, but ideally, you may be spending less than half a day on solely coding. The typical day-to-day basis during capstone weeks will be attending morning standups, engaging in peer reviews, and coding.

## Mental Health Resources
Taking care of our mental health is an important aspect of our life. Please make sure to take breaks, meditate, sleep, or go for a walk outside to do what's best for you to reduce stress. Here are some resources provided that can be informative.

- [Imposter Syndrome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CA5UZwDisg_1WMQIurtDsj4vOkWlZ0cZ/edit)
- [Programmer Imposter Syndrome](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6_x1iHqKi1aOAlKKUsx3f-jkhZUZhpM/view?usp=sharing)
- [Anxiety](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13BnCXH7XKsJhQOp_xaBH9E2BAwMTTJ2c/view?usp=sharing)

- [Avoiding Burnout](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1viR9dO-xOJSF6ouLsLs4vqvC5Qhy8dZY/view?usp=sharing)

## Google Calendar

This calendar is a great resource to know what the day-to-day basis will look like. There should be a "+" button at the bottom right corner, please add this calendar to your own Google Calendar.
- [Module 7 Calendar Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_al83m9o7es4b69frh3mk41ia68@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)

## Cheating
Students plagiarising another student's source code will be dismissed. This is an assessment to utilize the knowledge gained from the previous modules to build what you have learned.

<!-- ## Clobbering
Clobbering is the process of "updating" an entry in the database by deleting the old entry and creating a new one. Not only is this a slower process for your application due to having to perform 2 actions instead of 1, but this also does not accurately demonstrate your ability to fully CRUD in a feature. While developing your application, make sure that you are editing the existing entry in the database instead of clobbering. -->

## Camera Etiquacy
Students **MUST** have their cameras on during live lectures in Module 7, including during the Career Quest. Students who have their cameras off, are AFK/not present, or do not show their full face in the camera view, will receive a **strike**. Students who need to step away from the camera for a brief moment, please use the coffee reaction emoji on Zoom that says "I'm away". Students who need to be away from the camera for more than 15 minutes, please communicate with the staff. Students who may need to be cameras off for any special circumstance, please reach out to the Module 7 Staff.

# Phase 1 - Project Approval

## Capstone Project Proposals
All students should have a **target website** they will clone or use for inspiration. You must submit the [Google Project Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/VfwHSR88QZo73jUt5) and get approval from an IA before implementing the features. The deadline for all project proposals will have to be submitted by the **end of lunch** on W21D2. 

If you're currently waiting for an IA to review your project proposal, please utilize the time appropriately and continue to be productive *(initialize your project + deploy skeleton starter, set up your GitHub repo, project kanban board, etc.)*. 

The Mod 7 staff will review your GitHub repo wiki documents based on the submission order. You can view the queue to see when your project is being reviewed in the Capstone Project Proposal Responses Google Spreadsheet. [Link to Proposal Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkUpeCLUL0x7Oo8aVzzRiR3Kj55GHgHGbTXtsPoapp4/edit?resourcekey#gid=640829555)

*Note- Any project proposal without all the required wiki documentation will be disapproved and asked to complete.*

IA's will have open office hours during the **Project Approval Phase** to help provide guidance on project proposals.

### Project Proposal Form
After the required wiki documentation is completed on GitHub, submit this Google project proposal form.

Here are some capstone project ideas that tend to be associated with success in the observations of the IA's, but of course they are not a guarantee of success. Please note ***these are in no particular order*** and you are absolutely ***not required to choose one of these*** projects. This list may guide your thought process as much or as little as you feel is appropriate. Also, you can reference additional project ideas in the App Academy Open in Week 20.

## Important Notes
- Please note that **multiple user types upon sign-up creation are not allowed**. *(Ex- Business owner and customers)*

- *Please do not reference the **exact name** of the target website as this will be flagged by Google for being deceptive.*

- *If your feature includes an image or video upload, then you MUST include AWS s3 buckets for file uploads.*

- *Students who plan to update, add, or remove their user stories during project development need to be approved by their Project Manager.*

- Avoid using copyright resources for seed data.

> We want to diversify our project portfolio. If you already did a social media clone, then maybe try working on a traveling app or E-commerce app.

* CSS frameworks *(Tailwind, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, etc.)* are **not allowed**
* No Copying and Pasting CSS code

*Any questions related to third-party APIs (AWS, Google Maps, Socket.io, NPM Packages, etc.) that are outside of the curriculum are the student's responsibility to debug. IA's may offer advice/guidance but are not expected to help debug.*

### List of Approved NPM Packages
**The NPM packages listed below are already approved, free feel to implement these into your projects**

- Boto3 (AWS)
- Google Maps (@reach/combobox, @react-google-maps/api, use-places-autocomplete...)

## Lecture Questions Emoji System

Because IA's are asked to answer all questions asynchronously when possible and because capstone issues can often take hours to address, the IA's will use slack reaction emojis to communicate the status of your question. Please pay attention to these emojis and consider them official communication. If it seems odd to take emojis seriously welcome to the tech world!

# 👀
The eyeballs mean the IA's are aware of the question and are looking into it / discussing it in the Staff Room. There may be other questions ahead of yours and it may take time to resolve the question based on the complexity of the problem and how clear the question was, if screenshots or commits were provided, etc.

# ✅
The green check means that an IA or the student has confirmed that the question has been resolved. If this isn't correct, tag one of the IA's in the thread or re-post the question.

# ☑️
The gray or blue check means the question seems to have been resolved by an IA or other student but is awaiting some form of confirmation.

# ⚠️ or ❌
The alert emoji means the question may not be specific enough or may not show clear evidence of independent student research on AAO, Stack Overflow, Google, etc.

Before the IA's can effectively address the question, the student will need to add more information, screenshots, and a description of what you have done so far in terms of research and solution attempts.

Once you have revised the question, tag the IAs or re-post a new version of the question in the lecture questions channel.

### Good Question Template

To ensure the quickest possible response to a question, you are encouraged to literally copy, paste, and fill this out when asking a question in Slack.

1. What feature/task are you working on? (modals, API routes, React components, Reducer, etc)
2. Describe the problem (what are you trying to do? What is it currently doing?)
3. What error messages do you have? (server/front-end console, *if there is one*)
4. What have you done to debug? What have you searched/tried? (THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE)
5. Relevant code snippets/screenshots (crop, mark up, or explain them, but make sure that line numbers are visible)

---

<!-- ## Capstone Scorecards

All students should have access to their own scorecards. Inside the "capstone tab" in that Google Spreadsheet, students will fill out Student Name, Application Name, Github Link, Live Link, Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3, Feature 4, Feature 5, and Feature 6. Your PM will ensure that the capstone scorecard is filled out accordingly as they will be utilized for future grading purposes. -->

---

# Phase 2 - Project Development

## Daily Standups

This will **begin on W21D3**. You will have daily stand-ups with your Project Manager (PM). Daily standups will take place between groups of 3-5 students from your circle. <!-- Each student will take roughly 5-10 minutes to screen-share their **deployed app** and **code**. Students are expected to explain what they worked on Heroku and then explain the code and data-flow afterwards. Specific standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. Your PM will ask a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team as well as the PTMs and the Career Quest team. -->
Each student will take roughly 1-5 minutes to screen-share their Kanban board to discuss their plan for the day. Standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. Your PM will ask a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the Mod 7 team.

>**Please note: you will receive strikes for missing standups!**

### Questions For Students:

*Please note that all work must be shown on the deployed website, not localhost. We can not determine the progression of your project based on localhost alone.*

* What progress did you make on your goal from yesterday?
* What is your goal for today that you plan to complete before the next standup? 
* Do you foresee any potential blockers?

### Additional Questions That May Be Asked For Students:
* When did you last deploy?
* Is all the code you are showing deployed?
* Does your Project Manager approve of the goal?
* What is your project status in terms of user stories?
* Can you demo any CRUD of the feature on the UI?

### Other Standup Notes

* If **technical questions come up**, your PM will ask you to put them in the lecture questions channel as we will not have time to debug during standups.
* IA notes will include whether you met yesterday's goal fully / partially / not at all.
* IA notes will also include a 3-5 word description of your goal for tomorrow.

## Workflow Expectations

### Complete ONE FEATURE before moving on to the next.
* Expected General Workflow:
    * DB Tables => Backend Routes => Frontend Components => Error Handling => Styling

> This general workflow is what's to be expected and will help with understanding how the data flow works from the backend to the front end.
    
### CSS Styling
* Do not leave any default styling for HTML elements such as buttons, inputs, text areas, etc.
* CSS must look as if you have made a valiant effort. You are not expected to be a designer, but attention to spacing, font, and layout must be apparent.
* Your site must be intuitive to the user. Users must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.

### GitHub 
* Utilize creating a KanBan Board on Github to effectively manage your time in completing tasks and objectives.
* Make sure to push to GitHub daily. *(We want to see that garden green)*
* You are encouraged to use branches to complete your features and to push to your main branch when you have working functionality.
   * Please remember to test the feature not only on local but on Production as well to ensure it works as expected.

# Phase 2.5 - Peer Review

Peer Review will start on Thursday of the first week of capstone every day after lunch, at 12:30 PT / 3:30 EST for a total of 45 minutes. Students will get assigned a pair, posted to Slack every day, to review each other's code. Below are guidelines to help illustrate how peer review will work. Please note, that during this time, instructors will not be available for questions on Slack.

*Note- We will also do a short demo the morning of the day peer review starts.*

> This exercise is helpful to practice communicating what your code does when an interviewer or coworker asks you to explain parts of your code.

## Steps:

1. Choose who goes first. You each get 20 minutes and should have a timer set up.
2. Your **partner** will choose a specific file for you to read from.
    - Could be something you are proud of, something new, your redux store, your routes, your React components, your CSS, your API routes, etc...
3. You will begin reading your partner's code file line by line, explaining the workflow of their code.
   
## Things to consider:

1. This **IS NOT** time to mainly debug or code.
2. Both sides are responsible for getting equal time.
3. Students are responsible to give and receive constructive feedback and commit to the exercise.
4. IA’s will be jumping in rooms periodically to check progress and could ask questions! 
5. Students will receive strikes if not committed to the exercise *(webcam is off, no discussions)*
6. If you finish the section of code you had planned to go over early, pick another file and continue to walk through your code. If you are lost on what code to share, you can always go through the starter code!

## Tips:

1. Write down notes of things you notice about your code.       
     - Mistakes, things you missed, things you want to change, etc...
2. Pay attention to the way your partner has coded things.
    - Seeing how others' code can give new ideas! Or solve a problem you already have!
3. Use code-centric instead of human-centric language. _(refer back to AOO, W2, HW for Wednesday, “Empathetic Communication” for a refresher!)_
4. Ask clarifying questions.
5. Take notice of how your partner read and understood your code so that you can gauge your work’s readability. 
6. If your partner did have a hard time reading a line/snippet of code, be sure to add comments to those to help you understand your code in the future. 
7. Take feedback as something constructive and helpful for improvement. (On the flip side, be aware of how you present constructive feedback)
8. Go through the starter project code *(user auth)* if you finish early.

# Phase 3 - Feature Reviews / Final Grading

## Feature Reviews

Requesting Feature Reviews will begin on Monday of the second week of capstone development (W22D1) and go through until the end of Wednesday (W22D3). Ideally, your project should be nearly completed before submitting a feature review so we can point out as many bugs/corrections that will help prepare you for the final grading when projects are due. You can reach out to your project manager when your project is ready for a feature review. After receiving your Feature Review, your priority should be fixing any bugs listed in the bug chart.

**Note that Wednesday is the final day to request a Feature Review.**

## Review Your Scorecard
After receiving your Feature Review, please reach out to your grader to ask clarifying questions and to ensure what you need to work on. This is also optional if you don't have any questions and understand what to work on. After fixing the corrections from the scorecard, **please test on Production** to ensure it works as expected.

### Test Test Test Your Features
* Students are **expected** and **responsible** to test their deployed app before final grading.
    * Test the CRUD functionality of all implemented features.
    * Test the User Auth (login, sign up, error validations, demo user, logout).
    * Make sure that your site works for new users as well as the Demo/seeded users.
    * Check if the styling is consistent throughout the entire app.
    * Check to make sure error validations work as intended for user auth and all features *(check [Capstone Minimum Required Error Messages](https://github.com/whitnessme/capstone-minimum-required-error-messages) for more info)*
    * IA's will do their best to leave as much feedback as possible, however, **it is your responsibility to test the functionality on your app to ensure it still works as expected**.

## Final Grade
Upon final grading, you should see two tabs at the bottom of the scorecard Google spreadsheet labeled as **"Feature Review"** and **"Capstone"**. Your capstone project final grade will be in the "Capstone" tab. Students will transition to Career Quest, and the Mod 7 team will begin final grading student's projects during this time. Please try to avoid watching an IA live grade, your priority will be to focus on any lectures being given during Career Quest. Once all projects have been graded, the staff will announce it in the Slack channel. The last time to deploy any changes to your Render application will be at 8 AM PT / 11 AM EST. Any changes made during final grading will be **considered cheating and handled appropriately**.

Under the Capstone tab, students will see the status of their project, either as "pass", "fail", or "currently grading". Any capstone project marked as "fail" will take an academic deferral. Please do not view it as a negative outcome but as an opportunity to extend your learning to gain more mastery, which is imperative in the job search.

## Future Goals After Final Grade

What to do moving forward? Well, the journey has only just begun. As you get closer to graduation, students are encouraged to continue polishing up their capstone project. Students can also look at the constructive feedback left in the capstone scorecards for more considerations on what to work on. Get ahead of the game, in order to be greenlit after graduation you will need to have at least 3 features in your projects and have the general requirements *(favicon, readme, About Me Links, etc)* completed.

> "To become a better software engineer, is through repetition." The more features you continue to build, the more practice, the more repetition, and the better you will become at building features quickly.

## What Should Be In a ReadMe?
* Name of the project
* Link to live site
* *Optional* Link to your backend repo if you have a separate one
* Summary of what the project is and what it does
* Screenshots of your app in action (once completed)
* Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)
* List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* To-dos/future features
* Technical implementation details
   * Anything you had to stop and think about before building
   * Descriptions of particular challenges
   * Snippets or links to see code for these
* Links to contact you *(LinkedIn)*
* Endpoints (See example below)*

### Best Practices
* Divide your README into distinct sections
* List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility
* Include nice screenshots or GIFs to show and demonstrate the features of your application
* Include code snippets
* Include a link to the live site
* Provide instructions for how to install the project (if applicable)
* Include a list of technologies used in the project
* Include a list of any third-party APIs you used in the project

## About Links
GitHub and LinkedIn links should be located somewhere in the footer, splash page, and navigation/header. Please refrain from trying to place these links in creative places or as “Easter Eggs”. 

## How to keep your Render Web Application "Alive" Using CRON Jobs

### *Option 1* Console.cron-job.org/
This is the recommended way of setting up CRON jobs to ping your websites, [console.cron-job.org/signup](https://console.cron-job.org/signup). This can also be found in Week 23 D3 Homework For Thursday.

### *Option 2* The Google Scripts Method
Here is a GitHub repo to ping (not to be confused with the "ping" utility) your Render projects using Google Scripts. https://github.com/crespohector/welcome-to-mod-7/blob/main/GOOGLE_SCRIPT.md

### *Option 3* The Render CronJob Way (JavaScript Example)
If you prefer to use a Cron Job on Render, you'll need to write a program to make these GET requests to your site(s). Place it into a desired folder in your project and set that folder's relative path to the 'Root Directory' value in the Cron Job settings. Additionally, you'll need to set the 'Command' and 'Build Command' settings for the Cron Job and adjust the value in 'Schedule' to your liking. Also, note that Render will want your credit card information to set up a cron job and may charge a fee of $1 per month for this service. Please see the file 'genericKeepAlive.js' in this repo for an example script.
